              The Middle East with its endless sands, wide empty plains and
              tumultuous seas - the frozen plains of the Caucasus with its
              hard-to-get-to oil and gas - the swathes of North Africa, are all
              perhaps the most difficult regions to operate successfully in.
              Powerful winds, driving dust and heat, or extreme cold which
              subdue even the most resistant forms of extraction, are all forces
              that must be considered. If you're operating in such places, you
              need to consider who you would trust to supply you with offshore
              and land rig refurbishment, repair, as well as land rig design and
              manufacturing; equipment manufacture to API 16D, 7K and 4F
              compliance, Category III & IV certification, rig inspection and
              technical man power supply. Top Oilfield has more than two decades
              of experience in dealing with all this and more. We are a name
              that the oilfield industry believes in and that clients trust.
